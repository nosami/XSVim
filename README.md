# XSVim [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/XSVim/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/XSVim/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nosami/XSVim.svg?branch=7.4)](https://travis-ci.org/nosami/XSVim)


# Installation

Interact with Visual Studio for Mac as follows:

```
Visual Studio -> Extensions -> Gallery -> IDE Extensions -> "VIM" -> Install
```

Then close the current document that you are working on and open a new document to activate the plugin.

## 8.1 New Editor

Unfortunately, this addin does not work yet with the new editor that was made default in 8.1. To use this addin, make sure that the old editor is in use.

Alternatively, I have been working on making VsVim work for the new editor. If you want to try this out, please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/VsVim/VsVim/pull/2733#issuecomment-538998555)

# What works?

Most Vim commands should work. If you see something that doesn't work, please file an issue. There's a good chance that I just don't know about it.

# What doesn't work

- Vim split windows. XSVim uses VS for Mac's side by side mode to emulate this, but it's only possible to have 2 vertical split windows. `<C-w>s` and `<C-w>v` both switch to side by side mode.
- Visual block mode works for most tasks, but there are some differences in the way that VS handles virtual spacing at the end of lines.
- Selecting text with the mouse or using cmd+arrow keys doesn't switch to Visual mode
- No leader key support or configurable key bindings.

# Why don't the control keys work?

Some Vim keybindings (such as Ctrl-F, Ctrl-D etc) conflict with VS's own built in keybindings. However, there is a keybinding scheme included that you may apply if you want (Visual Studio + Vim)

# Looking for the latest release?

Check the [release page](https://github.com/nosami/XSVim/releases) as there is usually a more recent version of the addin here than on the Visual Studio for Mac feed. Grab the .mpack file and install it via Visual Studio -> Extensions -> Install from file
